Greetings and welcome to my dirty superbowl squares scripts.

The program is simple.

1.  You will be prompted to enter a name.
2.  You will be prompted to enter how many squares you want.

This will repeat until all 100 squares have been assigned.

The code is set up for The New England Patriots (NE) and the
Los Angeles Ram (LA) [Beat LA!]

The code will randomly assign all of the coordinates of a 10x10 grid to
the names that are entered to play.

The board is set up to have a winner after each quarter of the game.

The Patriots (NE) score is across the top.  The Rams (LA) score is along
the side.

A winner is determined by taking the ones digit of the Patriots score and the
ones digit of the Rams score and finding the name in the block.  There
is one winner per quarter.

The script is run by running 'ruby dirty_squares.rb' from the terminal in the
directory that the file is kept.

Thanks for playing.
